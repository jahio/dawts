# Previously this .gitignore was set to ignore everything recursively,
# then whitelist the stuff I wanted to _keep_ instead. I've since reverted
# that behavior and will now just delete what I don't want, or use .gitignore
# normally. I was previously using it this way to experiment with making this
# repo basically a backup of ~/.config, which is normally littered with junk
# dotfiles that you wouldn't want to back up most of anyway on Linux, but
# that turned out to be a PITA, so meh, screw it, back to the old way of
# keeping this in ~/Projects/dawts, then symlinking what I want into
# ~/.config/ from ~/Projects/dawts on system restore instead.
#
# Previous syntax example, for posterity:
#
# *
# */**
# !.gitignore
# !.gitignore-global
# !.gemrc
# !readme.md
